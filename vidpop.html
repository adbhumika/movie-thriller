        <h2>Final Destination</h2>
        <p>"Final Destination" movies are a series of supernatural horror-thrillers where a group of people
             cheat death after one of them has a sudden, vivid premonition of a deadly disaster (like a plane
              crash or highway pileup). After avoiding the event, they start dying one by one in strange, 
              unexpected accidents, as Death "corrects" its plan.
             The main theme is that you can't escape fate, and death comes in creepy, creative ways.
